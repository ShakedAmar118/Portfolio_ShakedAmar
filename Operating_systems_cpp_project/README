MAPREDUCE FRAMEWORK ‚öôÔ∏èüíª  

Language: C++  

Description:  
MapReduce Framework is a C++ project that implements the **MapReduce parallel processing model** using **kernel-level thread management**.  
The project demonstrates deep understanding of **operating systems concepts**, **multithreading**, and **synchronization**, providing a high-performance solution for concurrent data processing.  

This framework allows tasks to be divided (Map phase), processed in parallel by multiple threads, and then combined (Reduce phase) efficiently ‚Äî simulating the core principles behind large-scale distributed systems.

Key Features:  
* **Kernel-Level Threads Management** ‚Äì Direct control and synchronization of threads for optimal performance.  
* **MapReduce Model Implementation** ‚Äì Complete execution flow from mapping, shuffling, and reducing data.  
* **Thread Synchronization** ‚Äì Uses mutexes, atomic operations, and barriers to ensure thread-safe operations.  
* **Progress Monitoring** ‚Äì Displays real-time progress updates and stage completion information.  
* **Scalable Architecture** ‚Äì Easily adaptable to handle various workloads and data types.  

Why This Project Stands Out:  
* Demonstrates strong understanding of **C++ multithreading** and **low-level system programming**.  
* Implements the **MapReduce paradigm** ‚Äî a fundamental concept used in modern big data processing systems.  
* Showcases ability to manage **concurrency, synchronization, and performance optimization** at a kernel level.  
* Combines theoretical computer science principles with real-world, practical implementation.  

Usage Example:  
1. Compile the framework:  
   ```bash
   make all
