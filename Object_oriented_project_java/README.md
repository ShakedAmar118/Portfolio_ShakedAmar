ASCII ART GENERATOR ðŸŽ¨â˜•  



Language: Java  



Description:  

ASCII Art Generator is a Java-based project that transforms digital images into text-based art using user-defined character sets.  

The program analyzes each pixelâ€™s brightness and replaces it with a corresponding character, creating a detailed ASCII representation of the image.  

This project demonstrates strong skills in Java, image processing, and algorithmic thinking, while combining creativity and technical precision.



Key Features:  

\* \*\*Custom Character Sets\*\* â€“ Users can select their own characters or symbols to define the art style.  

\* \*\*Brightness-Based Mapping\*\* â€“ Each pixel is converted to a character based on its grayscale intensity, resulting in accurate shading.  

\* \*\*Fast Image Processing\*\* â€“ Optimized pixel-to-character mapping ensures efficient conversion for images of various sizes.  

\* \*\*File Export\*\* â€“ Save your generated ASCII art as a text file or display it directly in the console.  

\* \*\*Simple Execution\*\* â€“ Straightforward input/output interface for easy use.



Why This Project Stands Out:  

\* Highlights solid understanding of \*\*Java programming\*\* and \*\*image manipulation\*\*.  

\* Blends \*\*algorithmic logic\*\* with \*\*visual creativity\*\* in a clean, elegant way.  

\* Demonstrates attention to efficiency, clarity, and user experience.  

\* Provides a practical and visually engaging project suitable for portfolio display.



Usage Example:  

1\. Run the main program:  

&nbsp;  ```bash

&nbsp;  java -cp bin Main
